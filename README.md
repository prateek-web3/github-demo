# GitHub Features Demo Project

This project serves as a practical demonstration of key GitHub features, including:

*   **Code Reviews:** Encouraging collaborative code quality through pull requests.
*   **Merge Conflict Resolution:** Simulating and resolving conflicts during the merging process.
*   **Pull Request Triggered Tests:** Automating testing pipelines upon pull request creation.
*   **Terraform Integration for GitHub Automation:** Managing GitHub resources (like branches, repositories, webhooks) using Infrastructure as Code.

The project is a simple web application, providing a tangible codebase to work with and illustrate these concepts.

## Demonstration Scenarios

This project is designed to facilitate the following demonstration scenarios:

1.  **Basic Code Review:** Create a new branch, make a small change, and open a pull request for review. Discuss the review process and provide feedback.
2.  **Introducing a Merge Conflict:** Have two branches make conflicting changes to the same file. Attempt to merge one branch into the other and demonstrate the merge conflict resolution process.
3.  **Triggering Automated Tests:** Observe the `ci.yml` workflow running automatically when a pull request is opened or updated. Show the test results within the pull request interface.
4.  **Terraform for GitHub Management:**
    *   Use the Terraform configuration in `.github/terraform/main.tf` to create a new branch protection rule or a webhook.
    *   Apply the Terraform changes.
    *   Verify the changes in the GitHub repository settings.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  **Set up your development environment:** Install the necessary language runtime and dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3.  **Explore the code:** Familiarize yourself with the simple web application code in the `src/` directory.
4.  **Examine the workflow:** Understand the `ci.yml` file in `.github/workflows/` which defines the automated test execution.
5.  **Review the Terraform configuration:** Analyze the `main.tf` file in `.github/terraform/` to see how GitHub resources are defined.
